# nanoGPT-goal
nanoGPT-goal is a toy project to implement a GPT model (language model) using Pytorch following [Andrej Karpathy's Deep Learning series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy).
The model is trained on a dataset of football text commentaries extracted from [GOAL dataset](https://gitlab.com/grounded-sport-convai/goal-baselines)

This will grow into something more respectable over time :)
